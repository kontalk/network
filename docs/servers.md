Kontalk Public Network server list
==================================

Our network is made up of several servers working together to create a distributed network which will be able to handle load balancing and failover.

### Beta `beta.kontalk.net`
[![xmpp.net score](/data/beta_xmpp.net.png)](https://xmpp.net/result.php?domain=beta.kontalk.net&type=client)

This is where most of the updates from the server software pass before being distributed to the network. It's a VPS hosted at [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com/), it's owned by the Kontalk devteam and it's funded by donations.

### Halifax `kontalk.halifax.rwth-aachen.de`

> This server is currently unavailable.

This server is kindly offered by the [networking crew of the Dormitory](https://www.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/) of the Aachen university. It is managed by [Malte MÃ¶ller](https://github.com/mmalte).

### Astra `astra.casaricci.it`
This server replaced the Prime server for the web sites and the primary DNS server. It's a VPS hosted at [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com/), owned by [Daniele Ricci](https://github.com/mmalte) and funded directly by him.
*This server will enter the Kontalk network when the number of users will grow enough to need it.*

## Retired servers ##

### Prime `prime.kontalk.net`
This server used to host the legacy 2.x protocol. It was a dedicated server that was dismissed right before Kontalk 3.0 entered the beta stage. It's been partly replaced by the **Astra** server since.
Prime also hosted the web sites and the primary DNS server.
This server was owned by [Daniele Ricci](https://github.com/mmalte) and was funded directly by him.
